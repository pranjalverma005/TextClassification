# TextClassification
Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) is a popular algorithm for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, spam filtering, and topic classification. In this project, I implemented the MNB algorithm from scratch for text classification and achieved the same accuracy as other standard libraries like Scikit-learn.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the MNB model is the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which consists of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned nearly evenly across 20 different newsgroups.
